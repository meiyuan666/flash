# FLASH

- An Open Source *Heterogeneity-Aware* Federated Learning Platform
- This repository is based on a fork of [Leaf](https://leaf.cmu.edu/), a benchmark for federated settings.
- Target Conference: [IMC'20](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2020/)
- paper: [Characterizing the Influence of Heterogeneity in Federated Learning]()


## How to run it

### example

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imc20submission/flash.git
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# download data, modify code if needed, refer to Chapter.Dataset for more details
cd models/
python3 main.py [--config yourconfig.cfg]
# use --config option to specify the config-file, default.cfg will be used if not specified
# the output log is CONFIG_FILENAME.log
```



### results in paper

here is some examples for experiment result we reported in our paper

You can just modify the `models/default.cfg` and then run `python main.py`, here are some pieces of config details we used

- exp1
- exp2
- exp3


## What is FLASH?

Briefly speaking, we develop FLASH to incoporate **heterogeneity** into the federated learning simulation process. 


### Deadline

We add deadline setting for simulating failed downloading/uploading and time out training. Now deadline follows a normal distribution in each round, and each client has the same deadline in one round. You can set the deadline's normal distribution parameters in the config file.



### Heterogeneity

#### Hardware Heterogeneity

Each client is bundled with a device type. Each device type has different training speeds and network speeds. We also support self-defined device type(-1) whose parameter you can set in the code manually for more complexed simulation. Note that if a client's device is not specified i.e. None, the program will use real training time instead of the simulation time, which is not recommended.

The source code for measure the on-device training time is available in the [android](android/) directory



#### Behavior Heterogeneity

Each client is bundled with a timer, which is bundled with one trace. Timer gets the available time according to [google definition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01046.pdf). FLASH will run in ideal mode if trace file is not found or `behav_hete` is set to `False`



#### Data Heterogeneity

- data in each client is non-i.i.d
- you can set `max_sample` to control the max sample number in each client



### Round Failure

In federated settings, if there are not enough devices to upload the results in a round, then this round will be regarded as a failed round and the global model will not be updated. To simulate it, we add a update_frac parameter. If the uploaded fraction is smaller than update_frac, then this round will fail. You can also set it in the config file.



### Config

To simplify the command line arguments, we move most of the parameters to a config file. Also, we add some other parameters as put above for better simulation. Here are some details.

```bash
# line started with # (commented) will be ignored

# bool, whether to simulate behavior heterogeneity
hard_hete True
# bool, whether to simulate hardware heterogeneity, which contains differential on-device training time and network speed

## Datasets

### DL Datasets

#### FEMNIST

- **Overview:** Image Dataset
- **Details:** 62 different classes (10 digits, 26 lowercase, 26 uppercase), images are 28 by 28 pixels (with option to make them all 128 by 128 pixels), 3500 users
- **Task:** Image Classification



#### Celeba

- **Overview:** Image Dataset based on the [Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)
- **Details:** 9343 users (we exclude celebrities with less than 5 images)
- **Task:** Image Classification (Smiling vs. Not smiling)



#### Reddit

- **Overview:** We preprocess the Reddit data released by [pushshift.io](https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/) corresponding to December 2017.
- **Details:** 1,660,820 users with a total of 56,587,343 comments. 
- **Task:** Next-word Prediction.




### User Behavior Trace

- you can download the user behavior trace data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M62hlt2KpF6IRGZi_gEDv7DE3_s0_ihD/view?usp=sharing).

- modify the file path in [models/client.py](models/client.py), 

  i.e.  `with open('/path/to/user_behavior_trace.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f: ` 

- The trace tracks the device’s meta information and its status changes, including battery chargestatus, battery level, network environment, screen lock status, and screen on and off. (See more details in our [manuscript]().)



## On-device Training

the code we used to measure the on-device training time is in `OnDeviceTraining` directory

please refer to the [doc](OnDeviceTraining/README.md) for more details



## Notes

- Install the libraries listed in ```requirements.txt```

  - i.e. with pip: run ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```

- Go to directory of respective dataset `data/$DATASET` for instructions on generating data

- please consider to cite our paper if you use the code or data in your research project
